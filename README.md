# 👋 Hi, I’m Bismanpal Singh Anand  

I’m a **Software Developer & Researcher** passionate about building intelligent systems at the intersection of **AI, distributed systems, and full-stack development**.  

Currently pursuing my **M.S. in Computer Science** at **UC Davis**, I work at the **Exploratory Systems Lab (ExpoLab)** — developing next-generation infrastructure and developer tools around **[ResilientDB](https://resilientdb.com/)**, a blockchain-backed distributed database.

## 💡 What I Do
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Tools:** Building **ResAI**, a suite of intelligent developer tools integrating LLMs with distributed systems.  
- 🌍 **Full-Stack Engineering:** Developing scalable web apps and dashboards using **React**, **Node.js**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
- ⚙️ **Systems & Infrastructure:** Profiling and optimizing distributed systems through projects like **ResLens**.  
- 📊 **Applied ML & NLP:** Applying **BERT**, **Transformers**, and **data pipelines** for sentiment analysis and entity extraction.

## 🧩 Open Source & Community
- 🏗️ **PPMC Member — [ResilientDB (Apache Incubating)](https://resilientdb.com/)**  
  Contributing to open-source development of a blockchain-backed distributed database.  
  Lead initiatives integrating **AI-assisted tooling**, **smart contract frameworks**, and **observability systems**.  
- 💬 Mentor new contributors in system design, CI/CD workflows, and code quality best practices.
